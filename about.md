I'm a software engineer who uses their free time (???) to hack on a variety of personal projects. I'm especially interested in creative tools and unusual user interfaces. I find a lot of inspiration in studying old/historical software, and design paradigms that were abandoned or never fully explored.

## About this site

This site is built with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). Project pages are deployed from their respective repos, with a common [theme](https://github.com/vanjac/theme) template for cohesion. [Source code available on GitHub](https://github.com/vanjac/vanjac.github.io).

I use [GoatCounter](https://www.goatcounter.com/) for analytics on most pages. It doesn't track any personal info (see their [privacy policy](https://www.goatcounter.com/help/privacy)).
