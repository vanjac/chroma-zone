# welcome to the chroma zone

This is where I collect various apps, utilities, and other projects I've worked on.
Everything is open source and free for you to try.

## Projects Overview

- [**ChromaFiler**](/chromafiler/)  
  An experimental file manager for Windows, borrowing ideas from [Spatial file managers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spatial_file_manager) and [Miller Column browsers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miller_columns).
- [**N-Space**](/voxel-editor/)  
  A mobile app for building 3D interactive worlds. It has a unique interface built for rapid design and modification, and it has a logic system for making games. WIP successor: [N-Space 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/nspace/comments/10utdja/nspace_2_progress_update/)
- [**Aodix Enhanced**](/aodix-enhanced/)  
  A fork of the Aodix music sequencer to fix longstanding bugs and continue development.
- [**AR Recorder**](/ar-recorder/)  
  Use your phone as a 6DOF controller for Blender.
- [**SketchUp Extensions**](/su-extensions/)  
  Collection of extensions for [SketchUp 2017](https://help.sketchup.com/en/downloading-older-versions)+. The most useful of these is Hide Back Faces, which implements back-face culling.
- [**Spans**](/spans/)  
  Small 3D renderer for the Game Boy Advance. Features very fast solid triangle fill, optimized in ARM assembly.
- [**Tapedeck**](/tapedeck/)  
  An audio editor designed to be controlled with a MIDI DJ board and no screen.

### Currently working on:
