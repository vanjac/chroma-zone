# welcome to the chroma zone

> Hi, this site is still under construction! Some pages might be missing or unfinished.

This website is a collection of apps, utilities, and other projects I've worked on. I'm currently studying computer science, and I'm especially interested in designing software to be used in creative fields (like graphics, music, game dev, and video production), as well as unusual and unique computer interfaces that make complex systems more approachable.

## Projects Overview

- [**ChromaFiler**](/chromafiler/)  
  An experimental file manager for Windows, borrowing ideas from [Spatial file managers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spatial_file_manager) and [Miller Column browsers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miller_columns).
- [**N-Space**](/voxel-editor/)  
  A mobile app for building 3D interactive worlds. It has a unique interface built for rapid design and modification, and it has a logic system for making games.
- [**Aodix Repair**](/aodix-repair/)  
  A project to fix bugs in an old music sequencer program, through reverse engineering and code injection.
- [**AR Recorder**](/ar-recorder/)  
  Use your phone as a 6DOF controller for Blender.
- [**SketchUp Extensions**](/su-extensions/)  
  Collection of extensions for [SketchUp 2017](https://help.sketchup.com/en/downloading-older-versions)+. The most useful of these is Hide Back Faces, which implements back-face culling.
- [**Spans**](/spans/)  
  Small 3D renderer for the Game Boy Advance. Features very fast solid triangle fill, optimized in ARM assembly.
- [**Tapedeck**](/tapedeck/)  
  An audio editor designed to be controlled with a MIDI DJ board and no screen.

### Currently working on:

- [RISCy Save](/riscy-save/): an open/save dialog enhancer utility for Windows
- Updates to [ChromaFiler](/chromafiler/)
- Finishing this website
