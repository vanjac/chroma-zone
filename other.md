## Old Projects:
These are from high school or earlier, listed here for archival only.

- [**Visual Logo**](https://vanjac.github.io/visual-logo) _(2017-09)_  
  Small experiment based on the scripting system I designed for ARDROID. It combines a Logo-like language with a visual palette of commands which you can click to build programs.
- [**Spyfall**](https://vanjac.github.io/share/spyfall/) _(2017-06)_  
  An alternative version of the online [Spyfall](https://spyfall.crabhat.com/) game with new locations, made with some friends. It's designed to work without connecting to a central server.
- [**three**](https://github.com/vanjac/three) _(2017-05)_  
  3D game engine and map editor written in Python. I wouldn't recommend using this for any games.
- [**tiny game console**](https://github.com/vanjac/tiny-game) _(2017-05)_  
  Experiment in making an extremely minimal virtual game console.
- [**Modern Art 2**](https://vanjac.github.io/modernart2/) _(2017-04)_  
  Generates art pieces and constructs captions using recursive phrase templates.
- [**DTMF Control**](https://github.com/vanjac/interactive/tree/master/dtmf) _(2017-03)_  
  Recognizes touch-tone sounds from a phone, and uses them to control a mouse or keyboard. [Video](https://youtu.be/I2vBBda5kAw)
- [**UFSC-3D**](https://vanjac.github.io/sketches/ufsc3d/) _(2017-02)_  
  Tool to help decipher videos produced by the mysterious [unfavorable semicircle](https://www.unfavorablesemicircle.com/) account. It was discovered that, in at least one video, the RGB colors of frames map to XYZ points on a 3D object. You can see this most clearly with BREADTH.
- [**Seamonsters Library**](https://github.com/seamonsters-2605/seamonsterstemplate) _(2017-01)_  
  Library for robot code that I built for my high school's [FRC](https://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/frc) team. Features include: coroutine-based robot commands which can be assembled into sequences; a universal drivetrain controller that can be configured for any type/configuration of wheels; robot position tracking and path following.
- [**ARDROID**](https://github.com/Seamonsters-2605/Ardroid) _(2016-12)_  
  An Arduino robot controller app for Android, featuing a simplified scripting system. Designed to be used by middle school robotics classes, as part of a platform where students could design and build 3D-printed Arduino robots.
- [**FRC Tutorials**](https://seamonsters-2605.github.io/) _(2016-11)_  
  Collection of online tutorials and resources created for the FRC team. Some feature interactive graphics and simulations (eg. [Mecanum Drive](https://seamonsters-2605.github.io/archive/mecanum/)). *Note: currently maintained by someone else.*
- [**Code Slideshow**](https://github.com/Seamonsters-2605/SeamonstersCodeSlideshow) _(2016-09)_  
  Scrolls through a library of code and makes you look like a hacker.
- [**Instagram Simulator**](https://github.com/vanjac/interactive/tree/master/IGSim) _(2016-03)_  
  Simulates an old version of the Instagram iOS app. You can add your own photos and captions.

  Interpreter for an esoteric programming language.
- [**Christmas Engine**](https://github.com/vanjac/ChristmasEngine) _(2015-12)_  
  The engine isn't very interesting, but it includes a fun and top quality demo game.
- [**HexKey**](https://github.com/vanjac/HexKey) _(2015-08)_  
  Maps keyboard keys to piano notes in a special hexagonal layout, inspired by an app called [HexASound](http://hexasound.com/). Chords and harmonies are shapes.
- [**Interactive Timeline**](https://github.com/vanjac/interactive/tree/master/InteractiveTimeline) _(2015-06)_  
  A scrolling timeline that you can customize with dates, captions, and images. Works in a web browser.
