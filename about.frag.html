<title>About</title>
<h1>J</h1>

<p>I'm a software engineer who uses their free time (???) to hack on a variety of personal projects. I'm especially interested in creative tools and unusual user interfaces. I find a lot of inspiration in studying old/historical software, and design paradigms that were abandoned or never fully explored.</p>
